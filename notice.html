<title>Goodbye</title>
<center>
    <p>2022 flew by and we couldn't realize how time went fast, I still remember celebrating 2022's new year's Eve as if it happened only a few weeks ago.</p>
   <p>I would also consider 2022 one of the worst years I've ever lived, from having problems Irl to trying to spend some time online and relax but it just makes your experience worse by having to deal with odd actions of strangers, being mentally ill and comporting the same cocky behavior of others so you can be involved and accepted as an "honored" member in the community.</p>     
   <p>I've been slightly keeping myself from the mistakes I made in the past till now, which include discrimination in general then sharing/receiving/trading improper disgusting pictures which I don't want to specify, and always had to hide them, with mainly underage teenagers (I am one of them) from different platforms. I first made Discord in 2016 (I was 11) for joining a Roblox Military RP group when everything was chill and normal back then, looking at the present Discord forces me to see all the LGBTQ and the weirdest NSFW-related content and stuff that I don't tolerate makes me wanna go back in time and prevent this shit from happening, I wouldn't have experienced any of that but I was driven into due to the COVID-19 pandemic which made the world turn upside down for me, from failing my High School first year because of being sick for a total of 2 months and having to skip exams and lessons, to dropping out and getting unsocial with people I know well for long. I just couldn't accept seeing myself fail in front of my mates when I was described as the brainy person in the class and I didn't have the motivation to repeat the grade year. I didn't have any support from anyone back then, I grew up in an environment where I was never satisfied, where people of my area didn't share the same ideology as me, maybe I'm different. 2 years of living in a dark hole of the internet which was useful for me to get rich intellectually and partially financially but painfully, happily it comes to its end finally. I want to make a huge apology to those who I wronged even though I doubt they are reading this but I mean it.
   To those who may be having mental disorders and issues according to what I've seen widely on the platform, I ask the best for you to seek help as soon as possible before your life goes downhill, if you think it is already it's never too late you can always fix it.</p>
   <p>Since we are entering 2023 I want all things to change and forget the old me, luckily I made plans months ago for the next year which involves studying in a coding school and getting a part-time job.
Forget about me and I want you all to just know I wonâ€™t be around on Discord for a very long while, do not ever dm me because I will not respond as I disabled my account on Saturday 31st December 2022. If you have anything important or urgent to inform me contact me on Telegram: https://t.me/fair_s</p>
   <p>To those G's who spent time and had a good relationship with me, Thank you. But I got to cut ties unfortunately, it is for our good, my own least.</p>
   <p>Wish everyone the best, this is a goodbye from me and Farewell.</p>
